# aita_stereotypes_analysis
Examine posting and commenting behavior in r/AITA. 

I initially focus on the relationship between post and comment-section tone and post popularity. I measure post tone using the NRC dictionary for emotional intensity and valance, and consider if top posts are more likely to be intense and/or balanced in tone. I then consider whether top posts are more likely to have polarized comment sections measured by comment intensity and valance as well as the distribution of votes. 

## Main data sources: 
Data are sourced from pulling data from reddit for posts in the public aita dataset [here](https://github.com/iterative/aita_dataset)
The data creation is performed in [pull_aita_data.R](https://github.com/pkress/aita_analysis/blob/main/pull_aita_data.R)



## Initial Analysis

Initial Analyses are performed in [AITA Polarization Intensity and Popularity.R](https://github.com/pkress/aita_analysis/blob/main/AITA%20Polarization%20Intensity%20and%20Popularity.R) and discussed in [AITA-Polarization-Intensity-and-Popularity.pdf](https://github.com/pkress/aita_analysis/blob/main/AITA-Polarization-Intensity-and-Popularity.pdf)
