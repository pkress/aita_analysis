### Purpose: Analyze AITA posts and comments
##################)
#' # Is Polarization Popular on AITA?
#' 
#' I examined the top comments from top AITA subreddit posts from 2018-2019 
#' to explore whether
#' popular posts are associated with more engaged and polarized comments section.
#' 
#' AITA is a subreddit seeking to give access to crowdsourced social judgement
#' to clarify those sticky situations where we aren't quiite sure if
#' we're being an A-hole.
#' 
#' The analysis is comprised of three main steps: 
#' 
#' * Determining basic descriptive facts about the top posts
#' 
#' * Determining if more intense and balanced posts are more popular
#' 
#' * Determining if more polarizing posts more popular
#' 
#' Eventually, we seek to extend this analysis by exploring how post 
#' characteristics
#' (e.g. age of poster, family vs relationship content) may impact community 
#' responses to determine which biases manifest in this social judgement context.
#' Such an analysis would build off the analysis in Alice Wu 2019 (
#' here: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/alicewu/files/wu_ejr_paper_2019.pdf)
#' and Ferrer et al 2020 (here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02754.pdf).

# Basic Descriptive Facts ----
##################)

#' # Basic Descriptive Facts
#' 
#' We want to explore the overall distributions of the key variables in this 
#' analysis, and confirm that the data adhere to our expectations. We focus this
#' analysis on comments/replies, score, intensity, and balance. 
#' 
#' * Comments/replies refers to the number of comments or replies that a given
#' post or comment receives.
#' 
#' * Score refers to the net upvotes a post or comment receives. 
#' 
#' * Intensity is the ratio of the sum of words from 8 emotions to total words 
#' in a given post or comment. The values are calculated based on matching the 
#' words in the post or comment to the NRC dictionary 
#' (Saif Mohammadâ€™s NRC Emotion lexicon, 
#' see http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm). A post with 
#' a higher intensity has more emotionally laden words. 
#' 
#' * Balance is the ratio of the positive valance value to the sum of the 
#' positive and negative valance values. Again, the values are derived from the
#' NRC dictionary. A balanced post will have a balance of
#' 0.5, indicating that there are as many positive words as there are negative
#' words. 
#' 
#' ## Overall
#' 
#' First, we consider the data posts overall by checking if censoring over time 
#' is a big driver of comment counts or 
#' score. The following plots indicate that censoring isn't a driving issue.

#' ## Distributions of key variables in Posts

#' We observe that intensity is somewhat right skewed, so most posts
#' tend to be less intense than the most extreme posts. 
#' 
#' We observe that balance is fairly evenly distributed, but is centered
#' above 0.5. This indicates that balance varies by post, but tends to be a bit
#' more positive than negative.

#' 
#' We consider the distribution of comment replies, score, intensity and balance
#' to identify outliers or observations that should be dropped. 
#' 
#' We notice that an enormous share of comments have 1 upvote. Since this may
#' be a self-voted value and is therefore unrelated to a replies impact on
#' other people, we don't consider single upvote comments when investigating 
#' comment scores.

#' increase in replies, and a 1 percent increase in score is associated with

#' We observe that intensity ranges greatly and is severely right skewed.
#' Most comments tend to be very unintense, but some are very intense. Note that

# Post Intensity, Balance and Popularity ----
##################)
#' # Post Intensity, Balance and Popularity
#' 
#' We now turn to the relationship between post intensity and popularity. We
#' expect that more intense posts are likely to be more popular since 
#' many forum posters don't engage unless moved emotionally. Post intensity 
#' measures the emotional impact of a post, so we expect more
#' intense posts to correspond to more engaging posts. 
#' 
#' We also consider whether 
#' balanced or unbalanced posts are more popular. On the one hand, balanced
#' posts are likely to be more moderate in tone and thereby less engaging. 
#' On the other hand, unbalanced posts may be alienating or unambiguous, 
#' rendering them uninteresting.

## Intensity and Popularity ----
#' ## Intensity and Popularity
#' 
#' We measure intensity, as described above, based on the share of words in a 
#' post that correspond to emotional responses in the NRC emotion lexicon. 
#' 
#' We run a regression of post score on intensity, and find some 
#' correlation but no obvious trend. Similarly, post comments appear mostly 
#' unrelated to post intensity. As a result, the role of intensity and 
#' score remains inconclusive. 
#' 
#' One interesting takeaway is that 
#' the least intense posts (intensity<=0.06) are all low score/comments, while 
#' the some of the highest intensity posts have high scores and many commments
#' (intensity>=0.15). Additionally, almost all the very high score/comment posts
#' are in the middle intenstiy range. 
#' 
#' Perhaps there is some negative engagement response associated with overly 
#' bland or intense posts, though with the current lack of correlation it's hard 
#' to say.
#' 
#' Further analysis with a larger sample size and evaluation of specific 
#' emotions may give more insight into the relationship of emotional intensity
#' and post popularity.

#' # Polarization and Popularity
#' 
#' We now turn to the relationship between polarization and popularity. We

#' polarization measures the emotional impact of a post, so we expect more
#' polarization to correspond to more engaging posts. 
#' 
#' While polarization may be a good measure of emotional engagement, other 
#' explanations may exist. For example, non-polarized posts from particularly 
#' humorous or outlandish posts may also excel on the platform. This analysis 
#' seeks to determine whether polarization is indeed associated with popularity 
#' on AITA, which gives some indication into whether the most engaging posts are
